The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the snapshot has fully loaded.  This often happens when you try to access data from the snapshot within a callback function that is called before the asynchronous operation to fetch data from Firebase has completed.  The error message might not be explicit and will vary depending on the situation. For example, you might get a `TypeError` or an error related to undefined values.
