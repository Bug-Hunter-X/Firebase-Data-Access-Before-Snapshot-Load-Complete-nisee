This repository demonstrates a common but often tricky bug in Firebase: attempting to access data from a document snapshot before it's fully loaded. This can lead to cryptic errors that are hard to debug. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.js` provides solutions using promises and async/await.  Understanding asynchronous operations in Firebase is key to avoiding this issue.
